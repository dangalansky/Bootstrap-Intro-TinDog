# Bootstrap-Intro-TinDog
My First Exploration into the Bootstrap Toolkit

# Intro/Purpose of Repo
I am currently taking the London App Brewery 100 days of Python Course.
On day 58 the Bootstrap library was introduced. 

The concept for this page is based on Tinder if it were for dogs.
All content and formatting were taken straight from the London App Brewery.

# About the files:
This code was written using HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 5.1, Flask and Python 3.10.
Server.py is a python-based server built using Flask and must be run using Python to utilize this repo properly.
Index.html will not run the website because the file paths are formatted to Flask's standards.
All links are either self-referencial or inactive. 
However, all buttons do have hover functionality.

# ENJOY!
